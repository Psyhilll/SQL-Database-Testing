-- ✅ 1. Check for duplicate entries in a table
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM customers
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- ✅ 2. Find NULL values in important columns
SELECT * 
FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id IS NULL OR order_date IS NULL;

-- ✅ 3. Validate email format using a simple pattern match
SELECT email 
FROM users 
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%_@_%._%';

-- ✅ 4. Verify referential integrity (check if all foreign keys exist)
SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_id 
FROM orders o 
LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL;

-- ✅ 5. Ensure data consistency (check for mismatched values)
SELECT * 
FROM payments 
WHERE payment_amount <= 0; -- Payment amounts should never be zero or negative
